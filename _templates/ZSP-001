SWISS Plug Type.

Device is easy to open and has the four contacts for flashing similar to Sonoff devices. BUT VCC is 5v (goes through 1117-3.3v). Using the 5V pin on an FTD1232 adapter works (RX/TX are 3.3V).

Template configures red/blue LEDs and power monitoring (BL0937 chip). Calibration power monitoring is required. I got PowerSetCal:1093, VoltageSetCal:33418, CurrentSetCal:35. YMMV.
